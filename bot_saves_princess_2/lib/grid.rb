# The Grid class represents an n x n square grid - and the base functionality is nearly identical to iteration 1.
# Since version 2 provides the grid, I removed the validation and error handling.

# A Grid knows its size (n), its rows of characters, and provides
# helper methods for locating and working with positions - creating position objects.
# Grid Responsibilities:
# - Store the gridâ€™s rows as strings (each of length n).
# - Allow lookup of characters at specific row/column positions.
# - Find the coordinates of character 'm' or 'p'.
