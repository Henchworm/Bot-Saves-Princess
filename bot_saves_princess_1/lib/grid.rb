# The Grid class represents an n x n square grid.
# A Grid knows its size (n), its rows of characters, and provides
# helper methods for locating and working with positions - creating position objects.
#
# Grid Responsibilities:
# - Store the gridâ€™s rows as strings (each of length n).
# - Validate the grid shape (must be n rows, each exactly n chars, n must be odd - provides custom error handling.
# - Provide quick access to key coordinates (center, corners).
# - Allow lookup of characters at specific row/column positions.
# - Find the coordinates of character 'm' or 'p'.
